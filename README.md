# 42 Common Core Projects

The common core of 42 School's curriculum tackles a wide variety of themes, from the reproduction of standard library functions to the implementation of algorithms, 3d rendering and web servers.
The projects are divided in 7 ranks of increasing complexity. Each rank also contains a mandatory exam, where skills acquired on the previous rank are put into practice by solving exercises on a time limit.

### Note for 42 students
Make the most out of your 42 experience by trying to solve each and every exercise on your own or with the help of your peers. Do not copy and paste code from the web mindlessly, 
you will be just fooling yourself into pretending you know stuff you actually don't, and this can lead to unpleasant surprises during your evaluations (and your career, if you keep this up).
Remember, learning at 42 is free, and as such it is, for many people who may not be able to afford paid courses, a once-in-a-lifetime upskilling opportunity - you have the responsibility to make the most out of your time there to grow as a programmer. 
Each time you cheat, bear in mind there's someone else who could have gotten your spot at the school and taken this privilege seriously.
